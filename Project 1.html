<p>Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[4] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[5] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).

    Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team
     in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra
      Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014.[6][7] [8][9][10] Kohli has been 
             the recipient of many awards such as the Sir Garfield Sobers 
             Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test
              Player of the Year 2018; ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012,
               2017 and 2018 and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 
               2016, 2017 and 2018.[11] He was given the Arjuna Award in 
               2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017[12]
                and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, the highest sporting honour
                 in India, in 2018.[13] Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN[14] and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.[15] In 2018, Time magazine named Kohli one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[16] In 2020, Kohli was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of $26 million. Virat Kohli is the only cricketer to feature in Forbes.[17] In March 2021, Kohli became
     the first Asian celebrity to reach 100 million followers on Instagram.[18]</p>
